QUESTION 1 - Anthropomorphizing

Is there potential for users of your chatbot possibly anthropomorphize 
(attribute human characteristics to an object) it? 
What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? 
Can you think of any ways that chatbot designers could ensure that users can easily 
distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?
"""

Q1_your_answer = """

Definitely! We think that users' attribution of human-like traits to chatbots designed to simulate human conversation can lead sometimes to unrealistic expectations, as one may expect the chatbot to possess a level of understanding and a set of feelings that it does not have. Users may become frustrated or believe everything chatbots tell them, which can be potentially dangerous if they cannot understand chatbot’s bias and limitations.

QUESTION 2 - Privacy Leaks

One of the potential harms for chatbots is collecting and then subsequently leaking 
(advertly or inadvertently) private information. Does your chatbot have risk of doing so? 
Can you think of ways that designers of the chatbot can help to mitigate this risk? 
"""

Q2_your_answer = """

To mitigate the problem of privacy leaks, it is important to have the privacy of user’s data in mind from the very beginning of the development of a chatbot. Designers should provide clear information regarding how data is being used and take actions to increase privacy when inputted data by the user is being accessed at the different steps when computing them.

QUESTION 3 - Effects on Labor

Advances in dialogue systems, and the language technologies based on them, could lead to the automation of 
tasks that are currently done by paid human workers, such as responding to customer-service queries, 
translating documents or writing computer code. These could displace workers and lead to widespread unemployment. 
What do you think different stakeholders -- elected government officials, employees at technology companies, 
citizens -- should do in anticipation of these risks and/or in response to these real-world harms? 
"""

Q3_your_answer = """

In anticipation of the potential negative impacts of automation on labor, different stakeholders including government officials, employees at technology companies, and citizens, should work together to mitigate these risks. The government can enact policies to support workers through industry transformation, companies should prioritize developing technologies that complement human labor, and citizens can advocate for policies that protect workers. The past Industrial Revolutions serves as an example of a past technological transformation that ultimately led to overall economic growth, but efforts were needed to protect workers and ensure equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities.

QUESTION 4 - Refelection 

You just built a frame-based dialogue system using a combination of rule-based and machine learning 
approaches. Congratulations! What are the advantages and disadvantages of this paradigm 
compared to an end-to-end deep learning approach, e.g. ChatGPT?
