QUESTION 3 - Effects on Labor

Advances in dialogue systems, and the language technologies based on them, could lead to the automation of 
tasks that are currently done by paid human workers, such as responding to customer-service queries, 
translating documents or writing computer code. These could displace workers and lead to widespread unemployment. 
What do you think different stakeholders -- elected government officials, employees at technology companies, 
citizens -- should do in anticipation of these risks and/or in response to these real-world harms?
